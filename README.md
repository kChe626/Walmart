#  Walmart Sales Analysis — Python Cleaning, SQL Analysis & Power BI Dashboard

This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline for Walmart sales data using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. It covers everything from detecting encoding issues, cleaning raw data, exporting to MySQL, querying with SQL for insights, and finally visualizing the results using Power BI.

---

##  Dateset

- Source: [Walmart.csv](https://github.com/kChe626/Walmart/blob/main/Walmart.csv)
- Columns: Includes city, branch, category, quantity, unit price, total, payment method, date, and other transaction details.

## Objectives

- Clean and standardize sales data using Python.
- Run SQL queries for business insights on categories, branches, revenue trends, and payment methods.
- Visualize key metrics interactively in Power BI.  invoice_id — Unique ID for each transaction

##  Data Cleaning Process (Python)

The Walmart dataset was cleaned using Python (pandas) to ensure consistency and prepare it for SQL analysis and Power BI visualization.

## Key steps

- Standardized column names: Converted all column names to lowercase with underscores for easier handling in code.
- Standardized text fields: Cleaned fields like city, branch, category, and payment_method by converting to lowercase and trimming spaces.
- Converted date values: Parsed the date column using dd/mm/yy format, handling invalid or inconsistent entries safely.
- Cleaned numeric fields:
    - Removed $ symbols and commas from unit_price and converted to numeric.
    - Ensured quantity and profit_margin were numeric and filled invalid values with 0.

- Computed total: Created a total column by multiplying quantity and unit_price.
- Removed duplicates: Dropped any exact duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
- Validated data: Checked data types, missing values, and consistency of computed fields.

## Example cleaning snippet

Standardize column names
```sql
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip().str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')
```
Clean unit_price
```sql
df['unit_price'] = (
    df['unit_price'].astype(str)
    .str.replace(r'[\$,]', '', regex=True)
    .str.strip()
)
df['unit_price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['unit_price'], errors='coerce').fillna(0)
```
Compute total
```sql
df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['unit_price']
```
Convert date
```sql
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'].astype(str).str.strip(), format='%d/%m/%y', errors='coerce')
```

## Output

A cleaned dataset saved as [walmart_cleaned.csv](https://github.com/kChe626/Walmart/blob/main/walmart_cleaned.csv) ready for SQL loading and Power BI dashboarding.

## SQL Analysis Process

The cleaned Walmart dataset was loaded into a MySQL database for analysis. SQL queries were designed to generate business insights on sales, revenue, profitability, and performance across various dimensions.

## Key analyses performed

- Top-selling product categories: Identified the top 5 categories by total units sold.
- Monthly revenue trend: Tracked revenue patterns across months to uncover seasonality.
- Branch performance: Calculated total revenue generated by each branch.
- Payment method contribution: Analyzed the share of revenue by different payment methods.
- Average profit margin: Compared profit margins across product categories to identify higher-margin items.
- Revenue by day of week: Evaluated which days generated the most revenue to assess weekly trends.

## Example SQL snippet

Top 5 product categories by units sold
```sql
SELECT 
    category, 
    SUM(quantity) AS total_units_sold
FROM walmart_cleaned
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_units_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
## Output

- The queries provided actionable insights into category sales, branch contributions, payment preferences, and profitability.
- Results supported the creation of Power BI dashboards to visualize these patterns interactively.

##  Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to visualize Walmart’s 2022 sales performance using the cleaned dataset and SQL analysis results. The dashboard provides insights into regional, product, and time-based sales trends.

## Key highlights
- YTD vs PYTD Sales: Compare current year-to-date sales against the prior year-to-date, showing growth or decline.
- Bottom 10 Cities: Identify the cities contributing the least to YTD sales performance.
- Monthly Sales Trend: Visualize how sales evolved across months, highlighting seasonal peaks and dips.
- Unit Price vs Quantity Sold: Analyze price points and demand at the product level, broken down by city and category.
- Payment and Category Mix: Explore sales distribution across different product categories and payment methods.

## Dashboard Features
- Dynamic filters for year, city, and sales/quantity views.
- Waterfall charts, treemaps, and combo charts for intuitive understanding of sales drivers.
- Integration of SQL-calculated metrics and Python-cleaned data.
